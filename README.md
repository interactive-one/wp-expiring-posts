# Expiring Posts
This plugin adds functionality to expire a post on a given date.

It does this by adding a new "Expires" date field in the Publish box. 

By default a post never expires:

![Default expiry state](screenshot-1.jpg)

But you can add a date instead:

![Expiry set](screenshot-2.jpg)

Once that date is reached, the post is marked as expired and is no longer visible to the end user.

### Dev Notes
* the new post status is `expired`
* a filter called `exp_disable_expiration_for_this_post` exists to disable this feature on a per-post basis.

### FAQ
##### If I enable this plugin, what will happen to my existing posts?
Nothing, the posts current post state will remain unchanged.

##### Will I be able to see expired posts?
Yes, they will be visible in the _expired_ view within the post entry list for your post type.

##### Will this plugin work with custom post types too?
Yes.

##### If I have a post set to expire and I use the filter to disable expiry for a speicific post, what happens?
When the `exp_disable_expiration_for_this_post` filter is used, the UI for control post expiry will not be shown, and the post will not expire. In other words, the filter overrides post expiration.
